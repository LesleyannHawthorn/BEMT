			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>BEMT operates this website. It is BEMT's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

			<h4><strong>Website Visitors</strong></h4>

			<p>Like most website operators, BEMT collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. BEMT’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how BEMT’s visitors use its website. From time to time, BEMT may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
			
			<p>BEMT also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our site. BEMT only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
			
			<h4><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong></h4>
			
			<p>Certain visitors to BEMT’s websites choose to interact with BEMT in ways that require BEMT to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that BEMT gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, BEMT collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with BEMT. BEMT does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
			
			<h4><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong></h4>
			
			<p>BEMT discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on BEMT’s behalf, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. BEMT will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees as described above, BEMT discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when BEMT believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of BEMT, third parties or the public at large. BEMT takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
			
			<h4><strong>Cookies</strong></h4>

			<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. BEMT uses cookies to help BEMT identify and track visitors, their usage of BEMT website, and their website access preferences. BEMT visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using BEMT’s website, with the drawback that certain features of BEMT’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

			<h4><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong></h4>

			<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, BEMT may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in BEMT’s sole discretion. BEMT encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
