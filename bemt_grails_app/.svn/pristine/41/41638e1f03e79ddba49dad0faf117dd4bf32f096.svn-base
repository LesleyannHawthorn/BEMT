 				<h2>About the Survey</h2>
 				<p>A comprehensive online survey was distributed to approximately 450 biobank directors worldwide. Data surveyed included infrastructure and labor costs, funding mechanisms, types of biospecimens, specimens, products, and services with pricing.</p>
				<p>Data was collected from over 100 respondents and made available in the BEMT. By selecting "Summary Data", you can review summary information about the profile of the respondents, their spending information, and their reported cost recovery data.</p>
				<p>By selecting "Search Market Data", you can run a queries to return subsets of the ~100 respondents and view detailed information about their Labor, Equipment, Specimens, Products, and Services, etc.</p>
				<p>Below are some things to please keep in mind when reviewing the survey data:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Information provided by survey respondents are estimates in many cases. As a result, data can vary significantly from biobank to biobank.</li>
					<li>Quality of survey data is relative to the quality of the information provided based on the understanding and data available to each respondent - this data has not been validated.</li>
					<li>Survey respondents were requested to complete survey using USD ($), but adherence has not been confirmed.</li>
					<li>Data collected may not be the most current market data available as respondents may have provided historical data (for example, the price of equipment when it was purchased 5 years ago).</li>
					<li>In many cases, to protect privacy information, data was collected in the form of ranges versus exact figures.</li>
					<li>Survey data was collected and presented solely to provide guidance for users of the BEMT.</li>
