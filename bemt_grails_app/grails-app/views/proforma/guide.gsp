			<h5>First step is to add projects to My Forecast.</h5>
     	<p>Projects, as part of their definition, include specific specimens, products, and services.  Here you will forecast the volumes of each that you will deliver and modify your base prices (if necessary for them).  Add each project more than once if needed, and complete your forecasted sources of revenue this way.  Based on the “unit costs” information you defined for each specimen, product, and service, the BEMT will automatically calculate Gross Profit – which is the excess profit from delivering specimens, products, and services you have to cover the fixed expenses your biobank has.</p> 
			<h5>Second step is to add expenses to My Forecast.</h5>
			<p>For each type of expense category, click View/Forecast to add information for each of the 3 years.  Some expenses are more detailed than others.  For example, when adding Labor expense, you are ask to specify Full Time Equivalent’s by month for each labor category.  Make sure you have enough Labor, Equipment, etc. to support the operation necessary to deliver the specimens, products, and services forecasted.</p>
