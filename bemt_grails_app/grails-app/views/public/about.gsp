				<h2>About the BEMT</h2>
				<h4><u>Background</u></h4>
				<p>
					The Biobank Economic Modeling Tool (BEMT) was developed by the United States National Cancer Institute’s 
					Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research Branch (US NIH/NCI BBRB) to assist the biobanking community with 
					the economic challenges associated with initiating, operating and maintaining a high-quality biobank. 
					The BEMT is designed to facilitate financial planning and to help biobanking professionals better understand 
					the costs associated with running a biobank.  To that end, the US NIH/NCI BBRB conducted an online survey and 
					received responses from over 100 biobank directors and managers across the globe. The survey data was 
					used to develop the BEMT and covers key areas of cost recovery, including but not limited to:
				</p>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Cost of labor</li>
						<li>Cost of equipment</li>
						<li>Prices charged and volumes distributed of specimens, products, and services</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h4><u>Notable Functions of the BEMT</u></h4>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Ability for the user to review market data (de-identified survey results from biobanks) to inform the user about the costs, prices and volumes of labor, equipment, specimens, products and/or services.</li>
						<li>Maintain a database of key resources and their costs or prices (labor, equipment, supplies, specimens, products and services).</li>
						<li>Build a cost profile for specimens, products, and services that include the use of specific consumables and supplies, the allocation of direct labor and equipment costs and an indirect rate.</li>
						<li>Organize “projects” with different fee schedules and volume forecasts to address multiple types of end users.</li>
						<li>Build a three-year forecast to include forecasted cost recovery from specimens, products, and services distributed, including additional expenses across a variety of categories that are typically incurred while operating a biobank.</li>
					</ul>
